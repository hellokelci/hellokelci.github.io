# Hello 👋🏾
My name is Kelci Mensah, I'm currently a Cloud Architect at Google based out of New York City. This repository contains the source code for my portfolio website, [Kelci Mensah](coming soon). The entirety of this site was built primarily with React 18, Typescript, and Vite and is consistently updated.
